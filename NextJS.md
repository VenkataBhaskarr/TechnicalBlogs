# NextJS

` nextjs is a react framework which provides the building blocks to create a web application `


## what are the essetial building blocks of a web application?

> user interfaces
> routing
> data fetching
> rendering
> integrations
> peformance 

and many more...

## what is react?

react is a javascript library which provides functions to create user interfaces(one aspect of a building block).
library means it provides function but where to use when to use is fully dependent on you or in other words the control is on our hands
react does not opiniate in other ascpects of building blocks which made it popular to use 
so how for creating other building blocks we have various libraries and frame works to use

## what is nextjs then?

nextjs is a javascript framework which provides reamining buidling blocsk to create the web application 
one can adopt the react for building user interfaces and later use next for outing data rendering and you know for the backend stuff

## from javascript to react?

writing lots of javscript code to update the DOM is imperative style of progmramming,  in order to convert the imperative type to declarative type we hvave 
created react
so react is declarative UI library

which uses JSX format for updating th DOM but th eproblem is broowsers dont understand JSX where babel comes into the picture which converts the JSX 
intojavascript

react core concepts
`compnents`
`props`
`state`

now lets discuss eaxh of them

`components`

Ui is also further divedes into smaller buildigng blocks which can be reusable these are called components, we can declare compinents by creating a function
which returns a html element


`props`

so why props? beacaise they are used to padd data into cmponents dynamically the data flow is on=in one direction from parent to children compnents we
should use {} these wherevenwe need to jump inotjavasdipr land from jsx land

`state`

state is the dynamic information stored in the components which are continuosly changing with the user interactions 
to use those information in the UI react provide some kinf of functions called as hooks with which we can manage and use the state of a components
useState is such a hook
