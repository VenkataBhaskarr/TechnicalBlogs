## Contains information about various automation packages

I just wanted to irritate my friends on whatsup by sending some automated messages so ont he way to that i have learned about these packages

` pywhatkit `

> briefly pywhatkit is a class which contains so many methods to send automated messges to the target location.

> the more used method in this package is sendwhatmsg(param1 , parma2, param3, param4, ...) here the param1 is the target number in strings , param2 is the the targeted message and param3 is the targeted hour in 24clock and parma4 is the targeted minute.

> formally TSL


` pyautogui `

> briefly pyautogui is not specific for whatsapp it acutally as per my knowledge is a class which contains the important methods which directly access the text field of any current gui appilcation you are on.

> this classs automatically takes control of the current GUI you have opened and search for the place where users would give their input through the keyboard and pastes the text we had given before in the typewrte command and presses enter to forward it.

> formally TSL


` twitterAPIV2 `

> huh! exciting.. isn't it? literally sometimes i feel so exciting while seeing these API's they are like gold mines ok ok enough praising lets come into the picture

> I am creating a twitter bot for that specific reason i am using this API.

> inorder to create real time bots the important object in API is StreamingClient which is the class we should extend and there is one method on_tweet which we need to override to get our functionality up and running

> later create an object of StreamingCLient class add rules which retrieves the specific type of tweets we needed.

> and when the object is filled with items the on_tweet method is automatically be called.
