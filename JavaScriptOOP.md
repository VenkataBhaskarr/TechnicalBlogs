### Everything in javscript is an objectüòè......le primitive datatypes left the chat (jokes apart but still javascript wraps the primitives into object when it is mandatory).
### Object has properties and methods 
### In javascript window object is the mother of all objects(remember it's mother not father) which provides various properties and methods like the browser API methods and so on
### Important object properties and methods can be updated/modified no matter what type of variable you use unless you are using the freeze function.
