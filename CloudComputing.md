### Traditional hosting architecture

> dedicated server

one physical machone and can run one app and can provide the machine to single organization.

> virtual private server

one physical machine and can run multiple apps and can provide the machine to single organization.

> shared hosting

one physical machine and can run multipe apps and can provide the same machine to multiple organizations.

> cloud hosting

many physical machines and can run multiple apps and provides to multiple organizations.

### What are CSP's

CSP is a company which provides multiples cloud services and chaining these to form the cloud architecture.
on the other hand cloud platforms are the ones which provide certain number of services but not the every service put there.

### cloud services

In general there are so many cloud services that are provided all these services are inturn grouped into 4core services which are 

1. compute - servers
2. networking - doubt?
3. storage - harddrives
4. databases

### Evolution of computing

There are four types of computing in general

1. dedicated computing

### Cloud computing deployement models

> PUBLIC CLOUD
this model is also called as cloud native or cloud first approach where the software/application is completely build on cloud like the networks,storage,database and computations everything on cloud

> PRIVATE CLOUD
this model is also called as onPremise approach where the company has its own data centers and they are responsible for the complete management their IaaS 

> HYBRID CLOUD
this model as the name suggests is a hybrid of both public cloud and private cloud

> CROSS CLOUD 
this model is based on using the multiple clouds at a same time
