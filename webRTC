## An introduction to a famous protocol for real time coummunications(audio , video) THE webRTC

### What is webRTC ?
It is a protocol by which two peers cimmunicatre with each other thorugh low latency and standarized way

### webRTC protocol
Lets say two devices wants to connect to each other first they will collect some information about them 
1. what are the available options in which public can connect to me
2. what are the media options of my device
3. what are security measures of my device

Later these session data will be transmitted to each other by anything you know webRTC doesnot care(whatsapp , mail , ....)
now the two peers will connect two each other in a n optimal way

### NAT
network address translation

### STUN
Session traversal utilities for NAT
These are light weight servers that are useful to know the public/Gateway IP address of out local machine generally we are allocated with a private IP by 
router which by using NAT turns into the public IP and sends outside to the world but in order to gain peer to peer connection we some how should know
the public IP hence these STUN servers are used.
### TURN
Traversal using Relays around NAT
thius is kind of cemtralzed because here the NAT are kinda strinct and only acepts data packets from trusted servers hence the cleint will send the data 
packets to the server and the server will realy the message to the destination hence th ename traversl using realay around NAT was given to iut
this is kind of costly servers because one need to maintanin connections to bothe sender and erciver contiunuioslt fro the data
### ICE
Interactivity coinnection establishment framework
This is main compoinent of webRTC because it this is a protocol which collect all the condiataten here canditiate means all the possivble ways of data 
sharig like using direct IP localIP using STUN or if the NAT/firewalls are strict then by using TURN even.. to establish connection the ultimate
goal of ICE is to establish low connection/low latency connection to peer to peer
### SDP
session discription protocol it is the main component of webRTC this is the large string of Icwe candidates combined with th esecurity and media options
of the host system 

### working of webRTC

First A will collect its SDP and sends an offer to B via whatsapp/kdskdkdm later B will also get its SDP thprugh ICE framework and sends an answer to A
and then boom low latency peer to peer connection is established between these two devices.

Thank you
