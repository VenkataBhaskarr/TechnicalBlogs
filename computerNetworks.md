## what is computer network?

a group of systems connected through a communication medium and guided by a protocal is called computer networks.
 
## Computer Networks (vs) Distributed Systems?

1.Although both looks in a same way but distributed systems differ from the networks, in general distributed systems are built on networks and provide
some model to serve its users lets say WWW is a distributed system which provides a model to view the documents across the networks.

2.distributed systems are built using middleware a software which is present on the os in simple terms distributed systems depends on the operating systems
and the networks are independent of the operating systems.

## Architectures

> Client - server architecture

A classic example of client - server architecture is www where the websites would be hosted in server(a centralized computationally powerful computer) and we 
the clients would access them through the networks.

> peer to peer networks

In this kind of networks there is no fixed client and server d a single node can be served both as server and client.
