1.Although both looks in a same way but distributed systems differ from the networks, in general distributed systems are built on networks and provide
some model to serve its users lets say WWW is a distributed system which provides a model to view the documents across the networks.

2.distributed systems are built using middleware a software which is present on the os in simple terms distributed systems depends on the operating systems

> the networks based on the transmission technology are broadcast networks and point to point networks

> the networks that are under the category of scaling are PAN,LAN,MAN and WAN.

### LAN
