> svelte is a programming language / web framework used to build web frontend applications combining it with SvelteKit can be used to build complete 
> full stack web applications it is similar to next and nuxt.

> svelte apart from react and vue is most efficient because react, vue uses a virtual dom which does its work on the browser rather the svelte 
> uses directly changes the DOM when the state change

> more on this later..
