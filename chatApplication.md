# Building a chat application using sockets.io and nodeJS

1. Socket.IO is a JavaScript library that enables real-time, bidirectional and event-based communication between web clients and servers. It is particularly useful for building web applications that require real-time updates, such as chat rooms, online gaming, or collaborative editing.

2. Socket.IO works by establishing a persistent connection between the client and the server using WebSockets, which are a standardized protocol for two-way communication over the web. If WebSockets are not available, it falls back to other technologies such as long-polling or server-sent events.

3. Socket.IO consists of both a client-side library that runs in the browser and a server-side library for Node.js.
